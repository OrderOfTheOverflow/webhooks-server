# Nylas Webhooks

This simple express app is inspired from the example repo of
[nylas-nodejs/example/webhook](https://github.com/nylas/nylas-nodejs/tree/main/example/webhooks)
I made some changes as using async await syntax, error handling using try catch, folder structures,
before we used to run server locally and now we are making
use of heroku to make it run in the cloud (Heroku).

This app correctly responds to Nylas challenge request when you add a webhook
url to the [developer dashboard](https://developer.nylas.com). It also verifies
any webhook notification POST requests by Nylas. The aim of this repo is to be able to
create a callback URL for your Nylas application to log webhook notification using heroku app.

Make sure `node` and `npm` are installed on your computer.
